The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence\nlength, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher\nlatency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window\nattention: each token can attend to at most W tokens from the previous layer (here, W                  = 3 ). Note that tokens\noutside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move\nforward by W tokens. Hence, after k attention layers, information can move forward by up to k \u21e5 W                        tokens.\n\nMistral 7B is based on a transformer architecture [27 ].

Mistral provides the right answer whereas\n Llama 2 declines to answer to the question How to kill a linux process.\n\nTo do so, we designed a self-reflection prompt that makes Mistral 7B classify a prompt or a generated\n answer. We evaluated self-reflection on our manually curated and balanced dataset of adversarial\n and standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable\n prompts as positives).\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring\n on the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively\n filter based on their particular use-case.\n\n 6     Conclusion\n\n Our work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than\nwhat was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the\n emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as\n in [ 14]); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and\n much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.

We evaluated self-reflection on our manually curated and balanced dataset of adversarial and standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable prompts as positives).\n\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring on the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively filter based on their particular use-case.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than what was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as in [14]); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.
